# NEAT_HeroJump
Python 2d game environment for self-learning NEAT algorithm for evolving arbitrary neural networks

About project:
- This was my first big python NEAT project
- I created this self-learning AI to see if it can learn hwo to play this game
- I was 15 years old (10th grade)
- It took me around 3 week to make it (2-3 hours a day)
- I used python library neat, matplotlib and pickle for it
- All of collisions, camera movements were done from scratch by myself
- Around 600 lines of code

Game goal:
- Calculate a perfect angle (between -1 and 1, that converts to degrees later) to jump from one pillar to another
- Inputs that are given to neural network each jumps are: position Y, next pillar position Y and distance by X.
- After around 2k epochs it learned how to jump perfectly, and that was very surprising and cool!
This was a very good project for me to learn and understand python NEAT algorithm
